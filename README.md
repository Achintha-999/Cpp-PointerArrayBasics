# 📚 Pointer and Array Basics in C++ 🖥️

This project demonstrates the use of pointers and static arrays in C++ to return an array from a function.

---

## ✨ Overview

The code showcases how to use a **static array** within a function and return its pointer to the calling function. This is a common technique in C++ for working with arrays when you need to pass data between functions.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts Covered

- 🧊 **Static arrays:** Retain data after the function scope ends.
- 🎯 **Returning pointers:** Returning a pointer to an array from a function.
- 🔍 **Pointer access:** Accessing array elements using pointers.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **The `nums()` function:**
   - 🏗️ Declares a static array of integers.
   - ⌨️ Accepts user input to populate the array.
   - ↩️ Returns a pointer to the array.

2. **The `main()` function:**
   - 📞 Calls the `nums()` function and stores the returned pointer.
   - 🖨️ Accesses and prints the first element of the array using the pointer.

## 💻 Code Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int* nums() {
    int static numbers[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cin >> numbers[i];
    }
    return numbers;
}

int main() {
    int *p = nums();
    cout << p[0];
    return 0;
}
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. 🌀 **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Achintha-999/Cpp-PointerArrayBasics.git
   ```

2. 📂 **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Cpp-PointerArrayBasics
   ```

3. 🛠️ **Compile the code using a C++ compiler:**
   ```bash
   g++ arrays.cpp -o PointerArrayBasics
   ```

4. ▶️ **Run the compiled program:**
   ```bash
   ./PointerArrayBasics
   ```

## 📝 Example Input/Output

**Input:**
```
10
20
30
```

**Output:**
```
10
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🧊 **Static arrays** are used because their lifetime extends beyond the function scope, allowing the pointer to remain valid after the function returns.
- 🚫 **Returning pointers to local (non-static) arrays is unsafe** as their memory is deallocated after the function exits.
